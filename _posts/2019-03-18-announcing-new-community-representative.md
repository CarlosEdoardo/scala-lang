The Scala Center Advisory Board welcomes **Rob Norris** as a Community Representative.

Rob succeeds [Lars Hupel](https://lars.hupel.info) in the Community Representative role.  (Bill Venners continues as the other Community Representative.)

The Scala Center team sincerely thanks Lars for his great work since the beginning of the Center three years ago.  He has written and presented community proposals (see: [SCP-011](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/blob/master/proposals/011-debugging-symbols.md); [SCP-013](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/blob/master/proposals/013-sbt-migration.md)) and relayed community feedback and sentiment to the board.

We are grateful that Rob has accepted our invitation, and we look forward to working together during his time on the board.

Rob, aka [tpolecat](https://tpolecat.github.io/about.html), is familiar in the Scala community for:

* his leadership role in [Typelevel](https://typelevel.org/)
* his popular open-source projects, including [Doobie](https://github.com/tpolecat/doobie) (a database library) and [Tut](https://github.com/tpolecat/tut) (a tool for machine-checked documentation)
* his many conference talks on pure-functional programming
* his tireless efforts on Gitter and IRC to help newcomers learn Scala and functional programming

At his day job, he writes Scala code at the [Gemini Observatory](https://www.gemini.edu/), supporting astronomy research. ðŸ”­âœ¨

**Did you know?** The Scala Center turned 3 years old, check out our [first announcement](https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2016/03/14/announcing-the-scala-center.html) back in 2016, or watch [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO8kDSJb-Gs) where Martin explains how the idea came about. We also recommend to watch Prof. Heather Millerâ€™s [full talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeEAXpLp6Dc), to understand better how Scala Center fits in the wider effort of open source sustainable development.
