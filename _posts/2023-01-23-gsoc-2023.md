Calls for open source Scala projects for [Google Summer of Code 2023](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)!

After [the success of last year's edition](https://scala-lang.org/blog/2022/11/15/gsoc-report.html), the Scala Center is applying to participate GSoC 2023. We are currently reaching out to mentors to assemble a Project List for Scala GSoC 2023. This is a great opportunity for open source Scala project maintainers to get some fresh hands on their projects and help out new contributors at the very beginning of their Scala career!

If you maintain an open source Scala project and you would like to mentor a student, please get in touch with us at [scala-gsoc@epfl.ch](mailto:scala-gsoc@epfl.ch) by the end of January 27th(Friday). We can't wait to hear from you!
