[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a yearly event that consists of a series of small programming puzzles. The puzzles are released daily from December 1st to December 25th. The goal is to improve your understanding of your programming language of choice by solving as many puzzles as possible.

Last year, Scala Center started the tradition of participating in the challenge. This year, we are continuing this tradition, and also we are inviting you to join us!

We have created a new section for the 2022 Advent of Code on the [Scala Center Advent of Code website](https://scalacenter.github.io/scala-advent-of-code/2022/). There you can find the solutions to the puzzles, and also submit yours to be featured there.

If you would like to submit a solution to a puzzle, you can click "Edit this page" on the puzzle page, and then create a pull request with the link to your solution under the "Solutions from the community" section.

It is more fun to solve the puzzles together! So we have created a [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/632150470000902164/913451015246868530) at the official [Scala Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/scala). There you can discuss the puzzles, share your solutions, and ask for help.

Happy coding!
