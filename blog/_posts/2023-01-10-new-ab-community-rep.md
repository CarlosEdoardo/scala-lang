On behalf of the Scala Center Advisory Board I’d like to welcome Eugene Yokota
as a new community representative to the advisory board.

During the past year following [The Community Delegate Terms
proposal][delegate-terms] both of our previous community reps, [Bill
Venners][bill-announcement] and [Rob Norris][rob-announcement], stepped down in
order to make way for the next generation of community reps. I’d like to extend
the board's gratitude for the tremendous dedication and support both Bill and
Rob offered the board over the years. Bill has served the board since 2016 and
Rob since 2019.

In light of the Community Delegate Terms proposal, four out of eleven Scala
Center Advisory board members formed a working group to review recommendations
from the board for the next community rep. 

Some key questions that were considered when looking at the recommendations were:

Does this person:

- have a history of contributions to the Scala community? (technical and/or non-technical)
- have a history of community engagement?
- bring a diverse perspective and representation to the board?
- have a collaborative mindset?
- believe in the values and mission of the Scala Center?
- have a broad interest in the Scala community as a whole?

We considered these questions in light of what the expectation for a community
representative are:

- Spokesperson for the Scala community at Advisory Board quarterly meetings
- Gathering and expressing community’s opinion on certain topics related to Scala Center proposals
- Point of contact for community members/groups to review and help shaping community proposals
- Presents and defends community proposals at AB meetings

With all this in mind last November we made the decision on the nomination, and
we’re happy to introduce Eugene, who has been a dedicated enthusiast in the
Scala community for years. Mostly known for:

- Being the lead maintainer of [sbt][sbt]
- His [blog][eugene-blog], writing, and [tutorials][herding-cats]
- His many talks and workshops given at various conferences
- Community work in helping organize the [Scala Matsuri][scalamatsuri] conferences
- His endless mentoring online and beyond
- His tireless involvement and focus on ensuring diversity and inclusion are at
  the forefront of events and in our community, ultimately making Scala a safer
  more welcoming environment for all

We trust that Eugene will be a valuable addition to the board for his technical
ability, his dedication to diversity and inclusion, and his willingness to
engage with the community to bring positive change.

**Reminder** that all the Scala Center quarterly reports and board meeting
notes are public. You can find them [here][records]. You can also find the
current Scala Center quarterly roadmap [online][roadmap].

<sub>*Note from the Executive Director*: As we are publishing this blog post, we
are aware that in December 2022 Eugene has publicly [donated][support] to the
Center. The decision to invite Eugene was made prior to this event and in no
relation to it. We greatly appreciate the gesture, and underline for the readers
that the community representative at the Scala Center advisory board is by
invitation only, it is unpaid position, and with no donation is required.</sub>
