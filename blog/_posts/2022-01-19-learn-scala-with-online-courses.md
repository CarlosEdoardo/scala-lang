Happy new year to everyone! We hope 2022 will be of great joy, and will be a 
source of fruitful collaboration between the Scala Center and the community!

As you might be listing your 2022 goals, why not include Scala in it? 
Refresh your programming skills, acquire new knowledge, and get a new 
certificate!

In this post, we remind you of our online courses designed for both beginners 
and experienced programmers, we report on what happened in 2021, and we share 
our plans for 2022.

## 2021 Retrospective

In 2021, with the release of Scala 3 we updated nearly all of our MOOCs to 
Scala 3:

- [Functional Programming Principles in Scala],
- [Functional Program Design],
- [Parallel Programming],
- [Programming Reactive Systems] with Akka.

We also kept the Scala 2 versions of these courses online, but we observed 
that the majority of the learners took the Scala 3 versions (e.g., 97% in the 
case of Functional Programming Principles in Scala).

The only courses that still use Scala 2 are the courses that depend on Spark,
which does not yet fully support Scala 3 (see below our plans in this regard).

We also published a new course: [Effective Programming in Scala]. This 
course teaches programmers all they need to be ready to work in Scala.
We are proud to report that this course was one of the [100 most popular 
courses of the year 2021][rank] (out of the 2900 courses created in 2021 on 
various MOOC platforms). Thanks to Effective Programming in Scala, we believe 
that hiring should not be a concern for companies using Scala.

In total, in 2021, more than three thousand people completed a Scala online 
course! Thank you to them for trusting us as their teachers, and 
congratulations on acquiring new knowledge!

Finally, we have recently re-organized the website to have a
[dedicated page](https://docs.scala-lang.org/online-courses.html) presenting 
the Scala courses from the Scala Center. We also published a short video 
summarizing the main points:

## Plans for 2022

In 2022, we plan to update the Spark courses to Spark 3.2 and Scala 3:

- [Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark],
- [Scala Capstone Project].

Additionally, we plan to experiment with alternative online learning models.
So far, all our courses are self-paced and the assignments grading is fully 
automated. This model is perfect for autonomous learners, but we believe 
there is also a need for a complementary model, where learners would get 
code reviews from experts, and one-to-one sessions with instructors. This 
year, we plan to publish some of our courses under such a complementary model.

The Scala Center is committed to providing high-quality, free, Scala 
educational material. We are grateful to all the learners who pay to get
certificates of completion. Our work would not be possible without your support.
