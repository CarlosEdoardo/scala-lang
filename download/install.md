**To run Scala from the command-line, simply [download]({{ site.baseurl }}/download)
the binaries and unpack the archive.**

Start the Scala interpreter (aka the "REPL") by launching `scala` from where
it was unarchived. Start the Scala compiler by launching `scalac` from where
it was unarchived.

## Path and Environment

For quick access, add `scala` and `scalac` to your path. For example:

| Environment | Variable         | Value (example)
|:------------|:-----------------|:---------------
| Unix        | `$SCALA_HOME`    | `/usr/local/share/scala`
|             | `$PATH`          | `$PATH:$SCALA_HOME/bin`
| Windows     | `%SCALA_HOME%`   | `c:\Progra~1\Scala`
|             | `%PATH%`         | `%PATH%;%SCALA_HOME%\bin`
